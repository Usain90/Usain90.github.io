### Data Extraction and Visualization project using Python:

In this project I will try to answer some basics questions related to the titanic tragedy using Python.
1. Who were the passengers on the Titanic? (Ages,Gender,Class,..etc)
2. What deck were the passengers on and how does that relate to their class?
3. Where did the passengers come from?
4. Who was alone and who was with family?
5. What factors helped someone survive the sinking?


First we will get our dataset from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted)

After importing Python liberaries such as Pandas, Numpy and seaborn we will open the dataset in Python and set up it as a Data Frame:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas import Series, DataFrame
from scipy import stats
import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
%matplotlib inline
```
```python
titanic_df = pd.read_csv
(r"C:\Users\Usuario\Desktop\Titanic Project\data.csv")
```

Let's take a look for the first five raws of the data to understand the data:
```python
titanic_df.head()
```

We will start with the first question, Who were the passangers on the Titanic?
First we will check the gender of the passangers:
```python
sns.catplot("Sex",data=titanic_df,kind="count")
```
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/titanic-checkpoint_files/titanic-checkpoint_7_0.png" alt="linearly separable data">

As we can see there were almost twice as many men on the Titanic as there were women

Now let's seperate the genders by classes
```python
sns.catplot('Sex',data=titanic_df,hue="Pclass",kind="count")
```
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/titanic-checkpoint_files/titanic-checkpoint_8_1.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Quite a few more males in the 3rd class than females. However, it might be useful to know the split between males,females,and children. How can we go about this?
In over to do this, we'll treat anyone as under 16 as a child, and then use the apply technique with a function to create a new column
```python
def male_female_child(passenger):
    age,sex = passenger
    if age < 16:
        return 'child'
    else:
        return sex   
        
titanic_df['person'] = titanic_df[['Age','Sex']].apply(male_female_child,axis=1)
sns.catplot("gender",data=titanic_df,kind="count")
```
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/titanic-checkpoint_files/titanic-checkpoint_14_1.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Interesting, quite a bit of children in 3rd class and not so many in 1st! How about we create a distribution of the ages to get a more precise picture of the who the passengers were.
```python
titanic_df['Age'].hist(bins=70)
```
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/titanic-checkpoint_files/titanic-checkpoint_15_1.png" alt="linearly separable data">

We could also get a quick overall comparison of male,female,child

```python
titanic_df['person'].value_counts()
```
